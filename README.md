This is a fork of speed-to-fritz.
Its goal is to replace broken links in the scripts and getting it running again.
Note: This project is WIP and theres no guarantee this will be continued.
Retrieving old firmware gets harder from year to year, every contribution is welcome.
Im really unexperienced in using the codebase of speed-to-fritz so please be patient with me.
Anyone contributing to this project is welcome.

Thanks to AVM for still providing some of the old firmware and boxmatrix.info for documentation.
If you want to reach out to me, message me on discord (universeclient).
